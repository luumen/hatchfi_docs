## What is Hatchfi?

Welcome to Hatchfi! Hatchfi provides an API to connect any cryptocurrency exchange, wallet, or account. With the Hatchfi API, you can easily fetch information from crypto accounts, including:

*   Accounts

*   Balances

*   Transaction histories

To see a complete list of cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and accounts Hatchfi supports, check out our [Providers](https://hatchfi.co/providers) page.

The fastest, easiest way to get started with Hatchfi (in less than 5 minutes) is with our Sandbox Testing and Quickstart app, both of which can be accessed by signing up for the Hatchfi API. You’ll integrate Hatchfi into your site or app and then use our Hatchfi SDK or REST endpoints to retrieve the data you need from our API.

If you have any questions about Hatchfi or feedback on these docs, you can contact us or find us here:

## [](https://docs.hatchfi.co/getting-started#creating-a-project)Creating a Project

Before integrating Hatchfi into your application, you need to create a project. A project consists of:

*   Project name

*   Project Logo

*   Client ID

*   API Key

*   Secret Key

To create a project, navigate to the [Hatchfi Dashboard > Projects](https://app.hatchfi.co/projects) and create a new project.

Once you've created a project, add the `API Key` and `Secret Key` to your project's environment variables.

:::hint
ℹ️ Note that your Secret Key will only be shown one time. Please save it in your environment variables
